### *Description:*
For our first project, we chose to create an application that would randomize four different meals as well as cocktails on a separate link. 

Once a protein is selected, buttons of the random choice of meal appear. Each button opens a modal window with the title of the recipe, a photo of the prepared meal, a list of ingredients and their measurements, and directions on how to prepare the meal. 

The drinks portion of the application has the same functionality with a seperate link to its respective page.
