Our First Project we chose to create an application that would randomize 4 different meals. Along with drinks on a seprate link. A photo of the prepared meal,ingredients, and instructions would be produced once a protein is selected along with buttons of the choice of meal. The drinks would be the same functionality just have a seperate link to its respective page.

- Main contains of drop down menu of 5 different proteins
- Button that is titled "What are we eating" once clicked produces 4 randomized buttons with meal titles for the audience's choosing.
- 4 randomized meal buttons contain Modals that show the prepared meal along with easy to follow instructions and ingredients.
- Above contains a link for the same functionality for choosing drinks.

Below are screenshots / animations showing the appâ€™s functionality:
